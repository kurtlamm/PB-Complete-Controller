FPP Backups for setting up the PB Complete Controller by KurtControllers

Upload the JSON Backup file "PB_Complete_Controller_all-backup_v5" to the restore backup section of your PB Complete Controller. This will configure the servo motor ouptus, DC ouptuts, and initial configuration for the GPIOS.
